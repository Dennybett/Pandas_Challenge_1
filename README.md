### Practical Data Analysis

#### Project description

In this project, I accessed a dataset from a fictional e-commerce company. I used the dataset to explore and analyze data to address real-world business questions.

I was able to identify top customers, popular product categories, calculating profits, and more, in a dataset with over 50,000 entries. 

By the end of the task, I had acquired a practical understanding of data exploration, transformation, and analysis, This has been essential in preparing me for more complex data scenarios in my future career.
